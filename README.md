# Automatic Differentiation Library in Fortran

This Fortran library provides **multi-dimensional automatic differentiation** up to second order.  It can compute **gradients**, **Hessians**, and **Laplacians** (the trace of the Hessian).  The library supports all intrinsic signed numeric types with all available kinds, which are automatically detected at configuration time via CMake.  It provides derived types and defines corresponding interfaces for intrinsic operators and procedures.  Interfaces for binary operators include all possible combinations of derived types and intrinsic types.


## Requirements

- Fortran 2008-compliant compiler
- CMake 3.3.2 or higher


## Installation

1. Configure, build, and install:
   ```sh
   cmake -B build \
         [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-path>] \
         [-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=on] \
         [-DBUILD_TESTING=on] \
         [-DEXCLUDED_KINDS=<excluded-kinds>]

   cmake --build build
   cmake --install build
   ```
   - `<excluded-kinds>` is a semicolon-separated list of kinds to exclude (default: `K1;K2;K8;K16;HP;XDP;QP`).  Used kind labels are described in the documentation.  Excluding kinds reduces compilation time.

2. Optionally test the build:
   ```sh
   ctest --test-dir build/test
   ```
   - Can be run only if testing was enabled during configuration (`-DBUILD_TESTING=on`).


## Usage

1. Compile your source files using the library:
   ```sh
   <compiler> -I<install-path>/include \
              <source-files> [<another-source-file>...] \
              -L<install-path>/lib -lautodiff \
              -o <executable>
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   [LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<install-path>/lib] ./<executable>
   ```
   - The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` adjustment is required only if the library was built as a shared library (`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=on`).
